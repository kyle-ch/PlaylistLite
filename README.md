## Why does this exist?

- I love Spotify Premium
- I love being able to save my musically locally
- I love making massive playlists

Unfortunately I only have a 32gb iPhone and I'm running out of storage. I can't afford to upgrade because I spent all my money on Spotify Premium.


This program will create condensed versions of your playlists by random sampling any number of songs from your massive playlists.

Enjoy!
